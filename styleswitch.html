<h2>Carolyn Tevnan</h2>
<p>Carolyn Tevnan is currently a student in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, but how did she get here?</p>
<p>Carolyn is a passionate, and persistant individual. She challenges herself to be the best at every goal she sets her sights on. Carolyn attended high school at Newtown High School in Newtown, CT, locted in beautiful Fairfield County Connecticut. It was there that she discovered her passion for the humanities. During her senior year she was accepted into Le Moyne College, a private Jesuit College in Syracuse, New York. While she was an undergraduate there, in addition to pursuing a bachelors degree in Sociology with a concentration in Anthropology, she filled her private time by supporting groups on campus. These groups included the Student Environmental Coalition, where she created and led the subcommittee for Composting and Recycling on campus. She was also represented the Le Moyne college student body as a member of the College Committee for Environmental Sustainability. She was personally selected by the Le Moyne College Office of Admissions to represent the school as a Student Ambassador. She took great pride in this role, as she encouraged prospective students to begin their own academic careers at Le Moyne. She left Le Moyne College in 2010 due to a health issue that was later resolved. She anticipates completing her degree in the future. While back at home in Connecticut, Carolyn studied to become a Certified Nurses Assistant at Branford Hall in Danbury, CT. Working in healthcare for 3 years has given her top notch time management skills, great interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic. The plan going forward is to take these qualities that she has acquired, and apply them to a new career in web development.</p>
